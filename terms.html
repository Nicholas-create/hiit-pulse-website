      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: 15 November 2025</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the HIIT Timer iPhone application (the “App”)
        and this website. By downloading, installing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        HIIT Timer is a mobile application designed to help you run interval training and workout
        timers on your iPhone.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You may use the App only if you are legally allowed to form a binding contract in your country
        of residence. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Health and safety</h2>
      <p>
        The App is a timing tool only. It does not provide medical advice, training plans, or health
        guidance. Always consult a doctor or other qualified health professional before starting a new
        exercise programme, especially if you have any medical conditions or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        You use the App at your own risk. Stop exercising immediately if you feel unwell, dizzy or in
        pain, and seek medical advice.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Licence to use the App</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to
        download and use the App on an iOS device that you own or control, solely for your personal,
        non-commercial use.
      </p>
      <p>You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy, modify or create derivative works based on the App.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile or attempt to extract the source code, except where permitted by law.</li>
        <li>Use the App in any unlawful way or in connection with any illegal activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. In-app purchases and pricing</h2>
      <p>
        If the App offers paid features or in-app purchases in the future, pricing and payment will be
        handled through Apple’s App Store. All purchases are subject to Apple’s terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may change pricing or introduce new charges at any time, but any such changes will apply
        only going forwards.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        All rights, title and interest in and to the App and this website (including design, text,
        graphics and code) are owned by us or our licensors. You may not use our name, logo or brand
        without our prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the App in any way that could damage, disable or overburden our services.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems or networks.</li>
        <li>Use the App for any fraudulent or harmful purpose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind,
        whether express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties,
        including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
        non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any
        defects will be corrected.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising out of or
        in connection with your use of the App or these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our total aggregate liability in connection with the App and these Terms shall, to the extent
        permitted by law, be limited to the amount you paid (if anything) for using the App in the 12
        months before the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to the App</h2>
      <p>
        We may change, suspend or discontinue any part of the App at any time, including adding or
        removing features, with or without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last updated”
        date at the top of this page. If you continue to use the App after the new Terms take effect,
        you are deemed to have accepted them.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales
        shall have exclusive jurisdiction, except where local law in your country of residence does not
        allow this.
      </p>
