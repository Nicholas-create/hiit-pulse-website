      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: 15 November 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how HIIT Timer (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when
        you use the HIIT Timer iPhone application (the “App”) and this website.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        HIIT Timer is designed to be simple and privacy-friendly. We do not require you to create an
        account and we do not ask for your name or contact details inside the App.
      </p>
      <p>In general, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>App usage information (anonymous)</strong> – basic analytics such as sessions,
          screens viewed and general feature usage, in order to understand how the App is used and
          improve it over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Device information</strong> – such as device model, operating system version and
          app version.</li>
        <li><strong>Website analytics</strong> – when you visit this website, standard web server logs
          and analytics (for example, via a privacy-friendly analytics tool) may be collected in
          aggregated form.</li>
        <li><strong>Support information</strong> – if you contact us directly (for example by email),
          we will receive any information you choose to provide in that message.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate, maintain and improve the App and website.</li>
        <li>Understand how people use the App so we can make better design and product decisions.</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests and communicate with you when you contact us.</li>
        <li>Monitor performance, troubleshoot errors and keep the App reliable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Analytics and third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use privacy-respecting analytics services to help us understand overall usage trends.
        These services may process anonymised or aggregated information such as which screens are used
        most often or how many sessions occur each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data and we do not use invasive tracking such as cross-site
        advertising cookies.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy,
        or as required by law. Aggregated analytics data may be kept for a longer period for trend
        analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Children</h2>
      <p>
        HIIT Timer is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal
        information, please contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on where you live, you may have rights under data protection laws, such as the
        right to access, correct or delete personal information we hold about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below.
        We may need to verify your identity before we can respond.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect the information we hold.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee
        absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last
        updated” date at the top of this page. Any changes take effect when they are posted here.
      </p>
