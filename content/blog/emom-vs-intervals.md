# EMOM vs classic intervals: which is better?

EMOM ("every minute on the minute") is brilliant for strength-biased conditioning, while classic work/rest intervals are better when you want to switch off your brain and just move.

## What is EMOM?

Every Minute On the Minute means you start a set of exercises at the top of each minute. Whatever time is left in that minute becomes your rest period.

For example: 10 kettlebell swings at the start of every minute for 10 minutes. If the swings take 20 seconds, you get 40 seconds rest.

## When to Use EMOM

Choose EMOM when:
- You're working with weights or technical movements
- You want to pace yourself intelligently
- Quality reps matter more than pure cardio

## When to Use Classic Intervals

Classic work/rest intervals (like 30 on, 30 off) are better when:
- You want maximum cardio benefit
- You prefer not to think about pacing
- You're doing simple, repetitive movements

Both have their place. The HIIT Timer app supports both formats, so experiment and see what fits your goals.
