# Why a simple timer beats a complicated workout app

When your screen has feeds, badges and menus, it's easy to get lost before you even start warming up. A clean timer keeps the main thing the main thing.

## The Problem with Feature Bloat

Modern fitness apps want to do everything:
- Track your nutrition
- Count your steps
- Show you leaderboards
- Suggest workouts
- Sell you programs

By the time you've scrolled through all the features, your motivation has leaked out.

## The Power of Focus

A simple timer does one thing well: it counts intervals. That's it.

You decide the workout. You choose the movements. The timer just keeps rhythm.

## Less Friction, More Action

The best workout is the one you actually do. When your tool is simple and fast, there's no excuse not to start.

Open app. Tap preset. Begin.

That's the philosophy behind HIIT Timer. No feeds. No social features. Just clean intervals and a stopwatch.
