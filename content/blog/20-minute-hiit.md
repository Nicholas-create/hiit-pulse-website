# How to structure a 20-minute HIIT session

Not every workout needs an hour. Here's a simple 20-minute structure you can save as a preset and reuse on busy days.

## The Structure

Try 5 rounds of: 40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest, followed by a 2-minute walk. The key is choosing movements you can repeat with good form while your heart rate is high.

## Why This Works

This format gives you:
- Enough intensity to trigger adaptation
- Built-in recovery to maintain quality
- A predictable rhythm you can trust on tired days

## Sample Movements

- Burpees
- Jump squats
- Mountain climbers
- High knees
- Push-ups

The beauty is in the simplicity. Set your timer once, save it as a preset in HIIT Timer, and you're ready to train whenever you have 20 minutes.
