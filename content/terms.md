# Terms and Conditions for HIIT Timer

**Last Updated:** 15 November 2025

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the HIIT Timer mobile application (the "App") provided by HIIT Pulse ("we", "us", "our").

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you must not use the App.

### 1. IMPORTANT: Medical & Health Disclaimer

**You must consult with your doctor, physician, or other qualified health provider before starting any new exercise programme or changing your existing one.**

The App provides a timer and informational features, such as the "Cardio Age" calculation, for educational and motivational purposes only. The App and its content are **not** medical advice, nor are they intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you have seen on or through the App. All exercise involves a risk of physical injury. You agree that you are using the App's features **entirely at your own risk** and assume all responsibility for any injuries, damages, or health complications that may result.

### 2. Licence to Use the App

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the App for your own personal, non-commercial use on an iOS device that you own or control, as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

### 3. Intellectual Property

The App and all of its features, functionality, and original content are the exclusive property of HIIT Pulse and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works based on the App.

### 4. Privacy and Analytics

Your privacy is important to us. Our use of your data is governed by our **Privacy Policy**, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

The App uses an anonymous analytics service to help us improve its performance and features. This service does not collect any personal or health data. You may **opt-out** of this anonymous analytics collection at any time in the App's "Settings" menu.

### 5. Warranties and Service Availability

We will use reasonable care and skill to ensure the App is functional and as described. However, we do not guarantee that the App will be available at all times, or that it will be uninterrupted or free from errors, bugs, or viruses.

This does not affect any statutory rights you may have as a consumer under UK law (such as the right to digital content of satisfactory quality).

### 6. Limitation of Liability

6.1. Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude our liability for:
    (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence;
    (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or
    (c) any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by English law.

6.2. Subject to clause 6.1, we shall not be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, for any:
    (a) loss of profit, loss of business, or loss of revenue;
    (b) loss of data or information;
    (c) loss of business opportunity or goodwill; or
    (d) any indirect or consequential loss or damage,
arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.

6.3. Subject to clause 6.1, our total aggregate liability to you for all other losses arising under or in connection with these Terms shall be limited to the total amount (if any) paid by you for the App.

### 7. Termination

7.1. We may terminate or suspend your licence to use the App at any time, without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms.

7.2. You may terminate this agreement at any time by deleting the App from your device.

7.3. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately. All sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including, without limitation, Section 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.

### 8. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this document. For any *material* changes, we will provide reasonable notice, such as by an in-app notification, before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

### 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of **England and Wales**. You agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with these Terms.
