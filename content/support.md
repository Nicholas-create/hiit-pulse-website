## 2. Frequently Asked Questions

### The "Cardio Age" Feature

**What is "Cardio Age"?**

"Cardio Age" is an estimate of your cardiovascular system's fitness age, based on your VO2 Max. It is an informational feature intended for educational and motivational purposes only. As noted in our Terms and Conditions, this feature is **not medical advice**.

**Why is my Cardio Age not showing? / Why does it say "No Data"?**

This feature has three requirements to work. If it is not loading, please check the following:

1. **Health Permissions:** You must grant the app permission to *read* data from the Apple Health app.

2. **Health Profile:** Your Apple Health profile must have your **Date of Birth** and **Biological Sex** entered. The app needs this information for its calculations.

3. **Health Data:** You must have at least one **VO2 Max** or **Resting Heart Rate** measurement recorded in Apple Health.

**How do I get VO2 Max data?**

VO2 Max is typically recorded by an Apple Watch when you complete an outdoor run, walk, or hike of at least 20 minutes. You must start the workout from the "Workout" app on your watch.

**Is my Cardio Age accurate?**

"Cardio Age" is an estimate, not a medical diagnosis. It is calculated by comparing your VO2 Max to population data from the FRIEND Registry. The accuracy depends on how recent your VO2 Max data is, which is why the app shows a "Confidence Level". Please consult a qualified health professional with any concerns about your cardiovascular health.

### The HIIT Timer

**How do I stop a workout in progress?**

During an active workout, **tap the screen once to pause**. To stop the workout completely, **tap and hold** the screen for one second. A confirmation pop-up will appear.

**How do I save a workout?**

You don't need to! When you start any workout, its configuration (work, rest, and rounds) is automatically saved to your "Recent Workouts" list.

**How do I access my "Recent Workouts"?**

From the main timer setup screen, tap the history icon (the clock with an arrow) in the top-left corner. This will take you to your list of recent workouts.

**How many recent workouts are saved?**

The app saves your 20 most recent *unique* workout configurations. Duplicates are not added.

### Audio and Haptics

**Why can't I hear any sounds?**

This is almost always because your iPhone's **silent switch** (the physical switch on the side of your device) is on. Our app is designed to respect your silent switch. If the switch is on, all timer sounds will be muted.

If your silent switch is off and you still hear no sound, please check the "Sound Effects" toggle in the app's "Settings" menu.

**Will the timer sounds stop my music (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)?**

No. The app is designed to mix its audio with other apps. The timer sounds (like the countdown) should play "over the top" of your music, allowing you to train without interruption.

**How do I turn off sounds or haptics (vibrations)?**

You can enable or disable both sound effects and haptic feedback individually from the "Settings" menu in the app.

### App Privacy

**Do you track me or sell my health data?**

**No. Absolutely not.** We believe strongly in privacy.

Your personal health data (like your age, sex, and VO2 Max) **never leaves your device**. It is read from Apple Health, used for calculations on your phone, and is never sent to us or any third party.

We do collect some 100% anonymous analytics (like "app_opened") to fix bugs, which you can opt-out of in Settings. For a full breakdown, please read our Privacy Policy.
